# Advent of code 2021
## In this repository, you will find my solutions to AOC-21 in Java.

Each puzzle is a package containing a puzzle class and an input file. Input files contain inputs assigned to me by AOC.

Puzzles can be run from the Main.java class like this:

```java
Puzzle1 puzzle1 = new Puzzle1();
puzzle1.runPartOne();
puzzle1.runPartTwo();
```
